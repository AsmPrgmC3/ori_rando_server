## Development 
We welcome your contributions!
This server is a hybrid python 2.7 (flask) and react app, and has been built on App Engine using the cloudshell editor. As such, it can be a bit... tricky to set up a local environment for development. If you are interested, contact me (Eiko) in the [Ori Discord](https://orirando.com/discord)
